Gentoo Linux installation scripts

Goals:
- automated (as much as possible) installation of Gentoo Linux
- possibility to apply newly added functionality on existing installation

Installation:
- boot your machine using Gentoo Linux livecd
- download these installation scripts (current development branch name is '01')
    curl -L https://github.com/lypant/riuos/tarball/<branch_name> | tar xz
- change name of obtained folder to 'riuos'
- go to riuos/setup and adjust any settings in scripts, if needed
- start installation with execution of 01_install_base_system.sh script
- TODO write next steps
